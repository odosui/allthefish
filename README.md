# allthefish üê¨ 

AI coding agent with visual interface.

## Philosophy

- Visual observability of changes (e.g. we are running your projects in an iframe)
- Sanity checks (like checking typescript types, or running tests) are run automatically in a loop until the agent fixes the issue.
- Structured templates for frameworks instead of one big free-form text prompt.

Allthefish is designed to run coding agents against local codebases in a semi-copiloted mode.

## Features

- OpenAI and Anthropic models are supported. More coming soon.
- Default templates: typescript + react, Ruby On Rails. More coming soon.
